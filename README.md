# Jet Fighter Game
 This is a 2D offline game of 2 Jets, One White and the other Black, that are flying around able to shoot bullets.
You can either play with someone on the same keyboard or against an automated one that can shoot as well.

### Motion Keys
 As you'll see in the game, the White Jet can turn with the keys _A_ and _D_, shooting with _Z_.
And if you play with a friend, (Black Jet), he'll turn with the _Left_ and _Right_ keys and shoot with _L_.
All of that is already in the game.

### Word from Creator
 This game required a lot of math and had quite a number of issues to be solved.
In overall, making this project was fun and I hope you enjoy it.
